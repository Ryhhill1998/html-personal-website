      I am an ambitious and hardworking Computer Science MSc student looking for
      a graduate role in technology. I have been programming for just over a
      year and am comfortable with a large range of languages. I have an
      excellent understanding of front-end web development and enjoy building
      various projects in my spare time. My favourite project so far is my
      rendition of the viral game Wordle which I created in React. I am
      constantly learning new concepts and technologies to improve my skillset
      and am excited to continue this journey into my career.
